# Exceptions

1) If a user rates a movie with a metric that was not intended (ex. 11/10), the user will be prompted to re-enter the rating and explain the parameters (b/c it is an api endpoint.) (error handling for rating)
2) If a user wants to input a movie that looks similar to another movie title, they will be prompted to select from the following an make sure they are not just duplicating a movie. (if a movie to submit looks similar, first ask if they meant that)
3) When a user is verifying their email, if their otp is incorrect, they will be prompted to resend an otp or try again. (otp validation)
4) if a user adds more than 5 movies in the past hour, they will be told to wait an hour till they can add more movies. (spam prevention)
5) Exception: User writes fills out the entry incorrectly 
If a user attempts to fill in the wrong information in a field, then the entry will give back an error to the user and ask them to try again with the correct field. e.g. filling out the year of release instead of movie genre  (error handling for all)
6) A user wants to remove a movie from their watchlist that they don't have (tell them that movie was not on the watchlist to begin with)
7) The movie title doesn’t exist / the movie title has the wrong spelling. (could not find resource)
8) The recommendation algorithm fails to generate personalized suggestions (due to lack of data or algorithm failure). (default to popular if not enough user data)
9) The system fails to recommend interest groups due to lack of matching users or an internal error. (Prompt user to join an exsiting group from a list of groups) (to think of later more)
10) The system is unable to predict the performance of upcoming films due to insufficient data or algorithm failure. (if the cast is not definite for example, budget, genre, etc then say not enough info, try again later)
11) User tries to rate a movie but the submission fails due to network or server issues (Tell them to try rating again after _ mins).
12) If use tries to add a group that doesn't exsit (prompt them to create that group)



# Later Ideas
8) “I love using (name of our project) because it helps me as a film writer with my work. I want my current projects to do well and (name of our project) predicts if a movie will do well in certain demographics. If I'm writing for the action-comedy genre, it provides which subject matter do well and which ones don’t and gives me the average screen time of movies that do well. 
12) As Charmaine, I want to invite my friends, so we can find new movies to watch together
